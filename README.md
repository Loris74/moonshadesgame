moonshadesgame
==============

Moonshades is an old school Role-playing game. Runs in your browser, no download or install needed.
You can try the beta version here: http://www.moonshadesgame.com/
Requires the latest version of Google Chrome browser.

Using a fairly new browser technology, it doesn't require any additional plugins, only a browser that can handle a WebGL.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)
You should use the latest version of Google Chrome, other browsers aren't so reliable if you want to try it.
Ony one guy is working on it, so don't expect stunning graphics atm :)
This is a Beta build a lot of things are missing and bugs can still happen, but I think you can get an idea of what we are aiming for in the full version:). If you have any constructive criticism then don't hesitate, we would be thankful if you could help us out, even with your own ideas of what we are missing from the game, or what we should add to it.

Unfortunately large part of the code and the comments are in hungarian language.
